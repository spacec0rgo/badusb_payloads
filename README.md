# BadUSB payloads
This repository is a collection of payloads, mostly for Arduino IDE compatible devices.

Here is a list of compatible devices:
- Attiny85
  - Digistump Digispark
- Atmega32u4
  - Arduino Leonardo
  - Arduino Micro
  - Arduino Leonardo clones

## How to use

Download the repository files using either _Download ZIp_ or `git clone`. The directories are required by Arduino for every sketch.

All `.ino` files contain everything you need to make the sketch work.

> Each device folder has its own README.md with instructions on how to set everything up.

## Tips

I used heat shrink tubing on the boards. This way I can easily manage them without worrying about damaging the electronics.
